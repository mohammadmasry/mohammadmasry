- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mohammadmasry
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently diving into Python and exploring programming languages like Rust and Java. I'm also immersed in the world of health informatics.
- ðŸŒ± I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and health, and my studies involve delving into the realm of Health Informatics.
- ðŸ’¡ I have a keen interest in health, cars, video games, and various sports activities.
- ðŸ’» I'm enthusiastic about collaboration, especially with fellow students in European campuses. I love supporting and working with my teammates.
- ðŸ“§ You can reach me at moe.al.my@gmail.com.
âš¡ Fun fact: While I excel as a swift learner, being a Gemini, I find that maintaining consistency can pose an intriguing challenge. Embracing the duality of my nature, I navigate through learning experiences with adaptability and a zest for diverse knowledge. Any insights or support on achieving greater consistency are warmly welcomed!
